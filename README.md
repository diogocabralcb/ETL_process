# ETL_process
a simple ETL process script in python

This script transforms the extension of an xlsx file to csv and does temporary column creation, value replacement and column drop, to fix a problem of separator characters in the data source. Finally, it replaces the old file and saves a new file.

I uploaded an .ipynb file to run with Jupyter Notebook|Lab or Google Colab.
